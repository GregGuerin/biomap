# biomapME â€” Biodiversity Mapping and Macroecology
R functions for generating gridded biodiversity maps from point (incidence) data


===================================================

biomapME is currently under revision as of 2020. Additional functionality and changes to the way some functions are structured are expected. Stable versions of the original functions can be found in the archived version cited below.

Individual functions can be installed as follows (for example):
```
