# biomapME — Biodiversity Mapping and Macroecology
R functions for generating gridded biodiversity maps from point (incidence) data


===================================================

biomapME is currently under major revision as of 2020. Additional functionality and changes to the way some functions are structured are expected. Stable versions of the original functions can be found in the archived version cited below. However, some aspects do not work in the archived scripts due to changes in dependencies such as the mcp function in 'adehabitat'. 

Individual functions can be installed as follows (for example):
```
library(devtools)
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregGuerin/biomapME/master/phylogenetic.diversity.sites.R")
``` 


The development package (master branch) can be installed as follows (user beware—package rewrite in progress:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("GregGuerin/biomapME")
``` 

biomapME can be cited as:
