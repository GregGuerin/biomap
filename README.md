# biomap
R functions for generating gridded biodiversity maps from point (incidence) data


===================================================

Biomap contains a number of tested, self-contained functions but is currently under active development. Additional functions/functionality and changes to the way some functions are structured are expected over time.

Until biomap is published as a complete R package that can be installed as one, I  recommend installing individual functions as follows (for example):
```
library(devtools)
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregGuerin/biomap/master/phylogenetic.diversity.sites.R")
```
